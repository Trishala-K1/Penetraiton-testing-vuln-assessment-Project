# Penetraiton-testing-vuln-assessment-Project
Project Summary
You will write a penetration test proposal and plan. You will represent a cybersecurity consulting company specializing in penetration tests and risk management. You are replying to a Request For Proposal (RFP) by a fictitious company NBN. Review the project breakdown, pay attention to the requested details, and create a proposal for the customer. They will use your proposal to decide who to hire. Your proposal will be a complete test plan which you could later use as a reference.

Draft Final Report Breakdown (Proposal)
This final report itself will be broken up into five parts. The first four are due as part of the draft of the final report for the midterm. You can add additional information to the final submission once the pentest itself is done.

Final Report Section

Description

Executive Summary (you can leave the summary of findings out from the midterm draft)

Describe the high-level breakdown of the report as well as a summary of findings.

Introduction

Introduce your own (fake) company and the services you are providing.

Scope

Describe the scope of the test you are conducting/have conducted based on what is requested by NBN in their RFP.

Methodology

Describe the tools and techniques you will use/used that you have learned over the course of this class from the modules and labs.

Findings and Remediation (not necessary to include in midterm as this is the final portion that involves what you actually find during the pentest)

Report on findings you discover in the pentest in detail with evidence as well as the remediation steps for each. See the final modules grading guidelines for more details here.

Near-Earth Broadcast Network (NBN) is requesting penetration testing services for its IT infrastructure. The security assessment should focus on NBNâ€™s cybersecurity risk for outside threats and what NBN can do to minimize this risk.
